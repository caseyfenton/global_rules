# Context Window Management

This document provides a comprehensive overview of how context windows work in modern AI assistants and how to optimize your interactions with them.

## What is a Context Window?

The context window is the "memory" available to an AI assistant during a conversation. It includes:

1. Conversation history
2. Document content
3. Tool outputs
4. System instructions
5. Memories

## Context Window Structure

Based on analysis, the context window has the following structure:

```
~/.codeium/windsurf/
├── cascade/     # Main conversation flow (~700KB files)
├── implicit/    # Background context (20-120KB files)
└── memories/    # Persistent context (~1KB files)
```

## Context Types

1. **Conversation Context**
   - Recent exchanges with the AI (approximately 5-10 exchanges)
   - Most recent user request is always fully visible
   - Previous exchanges may be summarized

2. **Document Context**
   - Content from recently viewed files
   - Large documents are chunked (~60 lines visible at start)
   - Middle sections get summarized
   - End sections (~45 lines) shown in full

3. **Tool Context**
   - Tool calls and their outputs
   - Previous tool results remain visible for ~2-3 exchanges
   - Command outputs stay in context for next 1-2 responses

4. **Memory Context**
   - Persistent information stored across sessions
   - Small, focused pieces of information
   - Higher priority than older conversation history

## Context Window Behavior

### Content Chunking

When viewing large files:
- First ~60 lines are shown in full
- Middle sections are summarized (e.g., "<...59 more lines not shown...>")
- Last ~45 lines are shown in full
- Overlap may occur between chunks

### Context Retention Patterns

Priority order (from highest to lowest):
1. Current user request
2. Recent tool outputs (last 2-3 calls)
3. Recent conversation (last 5-10 exchanges)
4. Recently viewed document content
5. Older conversation history
6. Older document content

### Context Window Management

After 5 chunks of content, older chunks are marked as potentially invisible, with priority given to:
- Most recent user inputs
- Most recent tool outputs
- Explicitly created memories

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. File Viewing

- **View in chunks of 200 lines**: `view_file(StartLine=0, EndLine=200)`
- **Use shell commands** when possible: `cat file.txt | head -n 200`
- **Avoid viewing overlapping sections** of the same file

### 2. Tool Usage

- **Combine multiple commands**: Use `&&` to chain commands
- **Limit output size**: Use `head`, `tail`, or `grep` to filter output
- **Process output in chunks**: For large outputs, process in manageable segments

### 3. Conversation Management

- **Be concise**: Keep messages focused and to the point
- **Use memories** for important information
- **Reference previous information explicitly**: "As mentioned earlier..."
- **Chunk large requests**: Break complex tasks into smaller steps

### 4. Memory Usage

- **Create memories for key information**: Project structure, requirements, etc.
- **Keep memories focused**: One concept per memory
- **Use descriptive titles**: Makes retrieval more effective
- **Include tags**: Helps with categorization and retrieval

## Context Window Limitations

1. **Size Constraints**
   - Total context is limited (varies by model)
   - Older information gets pushed out by newer information
   - Middle sections of documents may be summarized

2. **Retention Issues**
   - Information from early in conversation may be lost
   - Complex code structures may be partially retained
   - Large files cannot be fully represented

3. **Priority Challenges**
   - System may prioritize recent but less relevant information
   - Important but older information may be dropped
   - Large tool outputs may push out other context

## Best Practices

1. **§CWMP§ (Context Window Management Protocol)**
   - Track context window usage
   - Split large files as needed
   - Process files >6000 chars in segments

2. **§FVP§ (File Viewing Protocol)**
   - Use shell commands for viewing when possible
   - Combine multiple file views into single commands
   - Avoid redundant file views

3. **§CTCP§ (Combined Tool Call Protocol)**
   - Merge multiple operations into single commands
   - Use shell operators (`&`, `&&`, `||`) effectively
   - Minimize the number of separate tool calls

4. **§MMP§ (Memory Management Protocol)**
   - Create memories for critical information
   - Update memories when information changes
   - Use appropriate tags for easy retrieval

## Testing Context Window Size

To measure context window capacity:

1. **Line Counting Test**
   - Create a file with 1000 numbered lines
   - Read the file in chunks of 200 lines
   - Determine how many lines remain visible in context

2. **Character Counting Test**
   - Create a file with varying line lengths
   - Read the file in chunks
   - Determine if context window is line-based or character-based

3. **Memory Size Test**
   - Create memories with increasing sizes
   - Determine maximum effective memory size
   - Test if memory size affects context window
