# Instructions for Al and Evie

Hi Al and Evie,

I've created this repository to share my global rules system with you. These rules help create more efficient, accurate, and consistent AI responses by providing clear protocols for various operations.

## How to Get Started

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/caseyfenton/global_rules.git
   cd global_rules
   ```

2. **Decrypt the rules**:
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     ./decrypt.sh
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```batch
     decrypt.bat
     ```
   - You'll be prompted for a password, which I'll share with you separately.

3. **Explore the files**:
   After decryption, you'll have access to:
   - `global_rules.md`: The core rules file containing all protocols
   - `EXPLANATION.md`: Detailed explanations of each protocol
   - `TOOLS_REFERENCE.md`: Reference for AI assistant tools
   - `LLM_PRICING.md`: Current pricing for commercial LLMs

4. **How to use these rules**:
   - Copy the contents of `global_rules.md` into your AI assistant's system prompt
   - For specific protocols, refer to `EXPLANATION.md` for detailed descriptions
   - These rules are designed to work with modern AI assistants like Claude, GPT-4, etc.

5. **Important tips**:
   - The rules are designed with a 6000 character limit in mind
   - You can customize the protocols to fit your specific needs
   - Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need clarification

I'm excited to hear your feedback on how these rules work for you!

Best,
Casey
